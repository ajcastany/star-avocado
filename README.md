# Star Avocado

---

## Preface

Star Avocado is a simple (and still incomplete) space exploration game featuring an Avocado.

This module sets the basic logic of the first half of the complete game, (still in the works).

Once completed, it will use React instead of the CLI to provide the user interface.

## Usage

Simply run in your terminal `python3 star-avocado.py`
